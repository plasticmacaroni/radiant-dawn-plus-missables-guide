Create a checklist using this format:
1. Categories are denoted with "# Category Name"
2. Items are listed with "- " prefix
3. Sub-items are indented with two spaces before the "- " prefix
4. Each item should have a type prefix:
   - ::task:: for regular tasks
   - ::missable:: for urgent/time-sensitive tasks
   - ::item_uncommon:: for special items
   - ::item_story:: for important notes
5. Links can be added using markdown format: [Link text](https://example.com)

Example:
# Shopping List
- ::task:: Buy groceries
  - ::task:: Milk
  - ::task:: Eggs
- ::missable:: Fresh bread (expires soon!)
# Work Tasks
- ::task:: Complete project report
- ::missable:: Submit timesheet by Friday
- ::task:: Check [company policy](https://example.com/policy)
